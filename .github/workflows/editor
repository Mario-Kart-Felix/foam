To get the most out of Prettier, it’s recommended to run it from your editor.

If your editor does not support Prettier, you can instead run Prettier with a file watcher.

Note! It’s important to install Prettier locally in every project, so each project gets the correct Prettier version.

Visual Studio Code
prettier-vscode can be installed using the extension sidebar – it’s called “Prettier - Code formatter.” Check its repository for configuration and shortcuts.

If you’d like to toggle the formatter on and off, install vscode-status-bar-format-toggle.

Emacs
Check out the prettier-emacs repo, or prettier.el. The package Apheleia supports multiple code formatters, including Prettier.

Vim
vim-prettier is a Prettier-specific Vim plugin. Neoformat, ALE, and coc-prettier are multi-language Vim linter/formatter plugins that support Prettier.

For more details see the Vim setup guide.

Sublime Text
Sublime Text support is available through Package Control and the JsPrettier plug-in.

JetBrains WebStorm, PHPStorm, PyCharm...
See the WebStorm setup guide.

Atom
Atom users can install the prettier-atom package, or one of the more minimalistic mprettier and miniprettier packages.
